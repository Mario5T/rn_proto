## Code of Conduct

This project follows the [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behaviour to the project maintainers.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** ≥ 18.0.0
- **npm** (comes with Node.js)
- **macOS** (required for the iOS Simulator bridge)
- **Xcode** with iOS Simulator (for running the sim-bridge)

### Fork & Clone

```bash
# 1. Fork the repo on GitHub

# 2. Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/rn_prototype1.git
cd rn_prototype1

# 3. Add the upstream remote
git remote add upstream https://github.com/Gravattack/rn_prototype1.git

# 4. Install dependencies
npm install
```

### Running Locally

```bash
# Start the Next.js dev server (Web UI)
npm run dev

# In a separate terminal — start the sim-bridge (requires macOS + Xcode)
cd packages/runner
npm run dev
```

The web UI will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Development Workflow

1. **Create a branch** from `main`:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```
   Use prefixes: `feature/`, `fix/`, `docs/`, `refactor/`, `chore/`.

2. **Make your changes** — keep commits small and focused.

3. **Run the linter and formatter** before committing:
   ```bash
   npm run lint
   npm run format:check
   ```

4. **Type-check** your code:
   ```bash
   npm run type-check
   ```

5. **Test** your changes locally by running the dev server and verifying in the browser.

## Commit Conventions

We follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```
<type>(<scope>): <short description>

[optional body]
[optional footer]
```

**Types**: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `perf`, `test`, `chore`, `ci`

**Examples**:
```
feat(editor): add multi-file tab support
fix(sim-bridge): handle simulator crash gracefully
docs(readme): update installation instructions
```

## Submitting a Pull Request

1. **Push** your branch to your fork:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Open a Pull Request** against the `main` branch of the upstream repo.

3. **Fill out the PR template** — describe your changes, link any related issues.

4. **Wait for review** — a maintainer will review your PR. Be responsive to feedback.
